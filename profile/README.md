## A) Prerequisites

To participate in this experiment, the following prerequisites are recommended:

1. A basic understanding of Java (version 11 or above) is sufficient for participation, but familiarity with annotations is recommended.

---

## B) Settings

The experiment consists of Java projects in which the volunteer must implement specific tasks as requested in each one. This section explains what you need to configure in your development environment. All Java projects in this experiment are Maven-based, which significantly reduces potential compatibility issues. If you already have a Java environment set up, changes will likely not be necessary.

### JDK

The Java projects in this experiment require JDK 11 or higher to be installed. You can download a version compatible with your operating system at:

[https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)

### IDE

The experiment has been tested using NetBeans and IntelliJ IDEA on Windows 10, Windows 11, and Ubuntu Linux 24.04.1 LTS.

Don‚Äôt worry if your IDE or operating system is different ‚Äî as long as your IDE supports Java development, you are unlikely to experience any issues.

Some IDEs you may use:

 - IntelliJ IDEA   
 - NetBeans
 - Eclipse
 - VSCode with Java extensions


### External Access

No external access, firewall configurations, or other network requirements are necessary to run the experiment.

## C) Background

Modern software applications often include features that, while valuable, are not always essential for every use case. Examples include real-time statistics, recommendation systems, or visual enhancements ‚Äî all of which may increase energy consumption during execution.

In scenarios where energy efficiency is a priority ‚Äî such as on mobile devices, in offline modes, during UI prototyping, or even in production environments where executing certain code paths is unnecessary ‚Äî it may be beneficial to disable or simulate the execution of these features without altering the application‚Äôs core logic.

This experiment introduces a framework that addresses this challenge using a lightweight, annotation-based mechanism in Java. The idea is to allow developers to control optional features at runtime, enabling or disabling them based on external configuration, while preserving the structure and maintainability of the code.

Even though the Greensfinge framework is used in this experiment, no prior experience with it is required. However, if you want to check, here is the link: [Greensfinge](https://github.com/EsfingeFramework/greensfinge). The goal is to evaluate whether a simple approach using traditional Java techniques can contribute to more sustainable software by reducing unnecessary computation and, consequently, energy usage.

To help participants understand the concept, the next section presents a complete, practical example demonstrating how to integrate the framework into a Java class and simulate behavior changes dynamically.

---

## D) Example Usage

This section demonstrates how to configure and use the Greensfinge framework in a Java project. It is divided into two parts: the **Conventional Approach** and the **GreenFramework Approach**. The first part will illustrate how you would typically modify the code using conditional logic to control features, while the second part shows how the Greensfinge framework simplifies this process by dynamically managing behavior with annotations and configuration.

### Explanation Using Conventional Approach

Imagine that you have the following code, where you would need to modify the logic by adding conditional operators to enable or disable specific features at runtime.

```java
public class MainService {
    
    private UserService userService = new UserService();
    
    public String mainOperation(){
        StringBuilder sbParam = new StringBuilder();
        sbParam.append("before processing");
    
        userService.doSomethingWithHighConsumeEnergy(sbParam);
       
        sbParam.append("after processing");
        return sbParam.toString();
    }
}

public class UserService {

    public void optionalFunctionalityWithHighEnergyConsumption(StringBuilder strParameter) {
        strParameter.append("something very high");
    }
}
```
Using the Conventional Approach, you would need to implement logic with conditionals inside the application's business logic, as shown in the code below.

```java
public class MainService {

    private boolean disableHighConsumeEnergy;
    private UserService userService = new UserService();

    public String mainOperation(){
        StringBuilder sbParam = new StringBuilder();
        sbParam.append("before processing");

        if(disableHighConsumeEnergy) {
            userService.doSomethingWithHighConsumeEnergy(sbParam);    
        }
        
        sbParam.append("after processing");
        return sbParam.toString();
    }
}

public class UserService {
    public void optionalFunctionalityWithHighEnergyConsumption(StringBuilder strParameter) {
        strParameter.append("something very high");
    }
}
```

### Explanation Using Green Framework
Using the Green Framework, you only need to follow 3 steps to configure it, without making any changes to the application's business logic.

- Step 1: Wrap your original class with the framework with `GreenFactory.greenify(UserService.class)`
- Step 2: Annotate your target with `@GreenReturnWhenSwitchOff` and `@GreenConfigKey`
- Step 3: Provide a runtime configuration using `GreenConfigurationFacade`

```java
public class MainService {

   //Step 1 - Use GreenFactory.greenif() to proxy the Object
   private UserService userService = GreenFactory.greenify(UserService.class);

   public String mainOperation(){
   	   StringBuilder sbParam = new StringBuilder();
       sbParam.append("before processing");

       userService.doSomethingWithHighConsumeEnergy(sbParam);
       
       sbParam.append("after processing");
       return sbParam.toString();
   }

   //Step 3 - Create the configuration to enable ou disable the invocation method
   public void optimizeEnergyConsumption(boolean config){
       GreenConfigurationFacade facade = new GreenConfigurationFacade();

       facade.setGeneralConfiguration(GreenSwitchConfiguration.builder()
        .ignore(config) 
        .configurationKey("OPTIONAL") // This key links to the annotation in your class
        .build()
       );
   }
}

public class UserService {

   //Step 2 - Use the annotations to tell the framework who and how to dynamically change behavior
   @GreenConfigKey("OPTIONAL")
   @GreenReturnWhenSwitchOff
   public void optionalFunctionalityWithHighEnergyConsumption(StringBuilder strParameter) {
      strParameter.append("something very high");
   }
}
```

This configuration tells the framework:

 - To ignore (skip) the actual execution.
 - To apply this configuration only to the feature annotated with the corresponding key.

These annotations serve as markers for the framework to determine:
- Which parts of the code are optional (via `@GreenReturnWhenSwitchOff`).
- How to match them with the runtime configuration (via `@GreenConfigKey`).

## Scenario 1 ‚Äì Product Recommendation System
Imagine a product recommendation system on an e-commerce platform. Every time a user accesses a product page, the system gathers statistics and displays suggestions based on popularity for an example:

"JBL 510BT Bluetooth Headphones received 1,231 visits this month.
Also check out HyperX Cloud Stinger Headphones!"

These insights are useful but not always essential ‚Äî especially when the goal is simply to demonstrate the interface, for example.

### ‚ùì Task
How can we ignore the execution without actually invoking business logic method?

---

## Scenario 2 ‚Äì Article View Counter
Consider a blog that shows the number of views for each article right below the title. By default, this number is updated with each new access:

"This article has been viewed 542 times."

Although this is a real data point, it is not always required. For instance, when focusing only on layout design or browsing offline:

### ‚ùì Task
How can we prevent the view counter from being executed without altering the actual counting logic?

---

## E) Experiment
You are required to complete two coding tasks, each using one of the two proposed approaches.

There are four available task groups. **The research team will assign which group you should complete**, so you will not need to choose it yourself.

> Once you receive your assigned group, access the corresponding tasks, review the requirements carefull and:
> - **Generate an participant ID you can use the link below [https://www.uuidgenerator.net/](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)** This will be useful when you fill out the form.
> - **Record your start and end time for each task.**
> - **Email us when you complete the task (View Contact Information).**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
> - If you are performing the experiment using the `Scenario1` and `Scenario2` projects, **you must modify the source code** of the application to implement the required behavior.
> - If you are working with the `Scenario1_Green` and `Scenario2_Green` projects, **you must NOT change the application source code**. In these cases, you should rely solely on the configuration mechanisms provided by the Greensfinge framework to simulate the behavior.


A detailed explanation of each task is outlined below.
